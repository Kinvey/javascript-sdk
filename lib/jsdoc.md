### Welcome
Thanks for choosing Kinvey to build your backend. This is your complete guide to the Kinvey JavaScript library, available for HTML5, AngularJS, Backbone.js, Node.js, PhoneGap, and Titanium.

### Overview
Kinvey provides a robust backend for your apps by providing features to enable you to build amazing apps without worrying about your backend. Currently, Kinvey provides the following services:

* [Data Store](/guides/datastore): a query-able data storage platform for your app.
* [Users](/guides/users): keep track of users of your application and control access to data on a user-by-user basis.
* [Caching and Offline](/guides/caching-offline): take your application offline without losing any functionality.
* [Files](/guides/files): a storage system for your media content (images, videos, files, etc.) that provides out of the box Content Delivery Network (CDN) capabilities.

For more details on how to use these features, read the [Kinvey JavaScript guides](/guides).
